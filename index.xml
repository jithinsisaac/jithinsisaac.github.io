      <description>AboutAbout the site  I remember using the omnipresent wordpress, blogpost and other CMS a decade ago, and hosting it on crappy hosting services with buggy implementations. Fast forward to 2020, the necessaity of a personal portfolio webpage inspired me to try something different. The result of which is an attempt to design and make this portfolio &amp;amp; blogging page. Searching around made me read about Static Web Pages and how it was taking over the domain of blogging, and basically sites with static content, by storm.</description>
